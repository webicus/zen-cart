If the products, categories, reviews have not changed since the last generation (time creation corresponding xml-sitemap file), a new xml-sitemap file not created (using existing xml-sitemap).

Priority is calculated on the basis of the positions in the selection from the database, ie the operator ORDER BY in the sql query. First item have priority=1.00, last=0.10. So can no longer be situations where all items in the file have the same priority.
Products - ORDER BY p.products_sort_order ASC, last_date DESC
Categories - ORDER BY c.sort_order ASC, last_date DESC
Reviews - ORDER BY r.reviews_rating ASC, last_date DESC
EZ-pages - ORDER BY p.sidebox_sort_order ASC, last_date DESC
Testimonials - ORDER BY last_date DESC

Support 3 $_GET parameters:
ping=yes - Pinging Google, Yahoo!, Ask.com and Microsoft.

inline=yes - output file sitemapindex.xml. In Google Webmaster Tools you can define your "Sitemap URL":
http://<your shop>/googlesitemap.php?inline=yes
And every time Google will get googlesitemap.php he will receive a fresh sitemapindex.xml.

genxml=no - don't generate xml-files.

rebuild=yes - force rebuild all sitemap*.xml files.

Comments and suggestions are welcome.
If you need any more sitemaps (faq, news, etc) you may ask me, but I will do only if it matches with my interests.

Install:
========
1. Unzip and upload all files to your store directory;
2. Go to Admin->Tools->Install SQL Patches and install install.sql.
3. Go to Admin->Configuration->Google Sitemap Configuration and setup all parameters
4. Go to Admin->Tools>Google XML Sitemap (If error messages occur, change permissions on the XML files to 777);
5. To have this update and automatically notify Google, you will need to set up a Cron
job via your host's control panel.

Tips
====

To run it as a cron job (at 5:0am like you wanted), put something in your crontab like the following:
0 5 * * * GET 'http://your_domain/index.php?main_page=sitemapxml'
or
0 5 * * * wget -q 'http://your_domain/index.php?main_page=sitemapxml' -O/dev/null
or
0 5 * * * curl -s 'http://your_domain/index.php?main_page=sitemapxml'
or
0 5 * * * php -f <path to shop>/cgi-bin/sitemapxml.php rebuild=yes

You can specify the location of the Sitemap using a robots.txt file. To do this, simply add the following line:
Sitemap: http://<your shop>/sitemapindex.xml
This directive is independent of the user-agent line, so it doesn't matter where you place it in your file.
If you have a Sitemap index file, you can include the location of just that file. You don't need to list
each individual Sitemap listed in the index file.
