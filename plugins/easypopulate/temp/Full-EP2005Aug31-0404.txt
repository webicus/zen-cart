How you navigate the world will depend largely on which game - single player or multipayer - you're playing. The single player experience, with a few exceptions, will see Elayna traversing the world mainly by foot (with a couple notable exceptions). In the multiplayer experience, your character will have more access to travel via Ter'angreal, Portal Stones, and the Ways. However you move around, though, you'll quickly discover that means of locomotion can easily become the least of the your worries...<br><br>During your travels, you quickly discover that four locations are crucial to your success in the game. Not surprisingly, these locations are the homes of The Wheel of Time's main characters. Some of these places are ripped directly from the pages of Jordan's books, made flesh with Legend's unparalleled pixel-pushing ways. Other places are specific to the game, conceived and executed with the intent of expanding this game world even further. Either way, they provide a backdrop for some of the most intense first person action and strategy you'll have this year.	www.wheeloftime.com	99.99	10		2003-11-03 12:32:17	16	GT Interactive	Software	Strategy						Taxable Goods	1	EOREOR

PC-TWOF	gt_interactive/wheel_of_time.gif	The Wheel Of Time Linked	The world in which The Wheel of Time takes place is lifted directly out of Jordan's pages; it's huge and consists of many different environments. How you navigate the world will depend largely on which game - single player or multipayer - you're playing. The single player experience, with a few exceptions, will see Elayna traversing the world mainly by foot (with a couple notable exceptions). In the multiplayer experience, your character will have more access to travel via Ter'angreal, Portal Stones, and the Ways. However you move around, though, you'll quickly discover that means of locomotion can easily become the least of the your worries...<br><br>During your travels, you quickly discover that four locations are crucial to your success in the game. Not surprisingly, these locations are the homes of The Wheel of Time's main characters. Some of these places are ripped directly from the pages of Jordan's books, made flesh with Legend's unparalleled pixel-pushing ways. Other places are specific to the game, conceived and executed with the intent of expanding this game world even further. Either way, they provide a backdrop for some of the most intense first person action and strategy you'll have this year.	www.wheeloftime.com	99.99	10		2003-11-03 12:32:17	16	GT Interactive	Big Linked							Taxable Goods	1	EOREOR

This will allow it to show in both the Category and Document Sidebox.

PFS	samples/5_small.jpg	Sample of Product Free Shipping Type	<p>Product Free Shipping can be setup to highlight the Free Shipping aspect of the product. <br /><br />These pages include a Free Shipping Image on them. <br /><br />You can define the ALWAYS_FREE_SHIPPING_ICON in the language file. This can be Text, Image, Text/Image Combo or nothing. <br /><br />The weight does not matter on Always Free Shipping if you set Always Free Shipping to Yes. <br /><br />Be sure to have the Free Shipping Module Turned on! Otherwise, if this is the only product in the cart, it will not be able to be shipped. <br /><br />Notice that this is defined with a weight of 5lbs. But because of the Always Free Shipping being set to Y there will be no shipping charges for this product. <br /><br />You do not have to use the Product Free Shipping product type just to use Always Free Shipping. But the reason you may want to do this is so that the layout of the Product Free Shipping product info page can be layout specifically for the Free Shipping aspect of the product. <br /><br />This includes a READONLY attribute for Option Name: Shipping and Option Value: Free Shipping Included. READONLY attributes do not show on the options for the order.</p>		3.95	5		2004-07-12 15:39:18	1000	Mixed Product Types	Mixed Product Types							--none--	0	EOREOR
