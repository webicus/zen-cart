1) Change the name of the "admin" directory in this package to suit your zencart installation
2) The temp folder is configured to reside in your store directory. If you store is not in the 
   site root (eg. /mystore/) then the temp directory must also go in this directory.
3) If you want to re-name the uploads (temp) folder, ensure that you configure Easy Populate to
   reflect this change after installation
4) Upload all files in their respective directories.
5) Go to Admin -> Tools -> Easy Populate. If prompted to install Easy Populate, click on the
   link provided. Otherwise, type in your browser address bar ?langer=install after /easypopulate.php
   (eg. YOUR_ADMIN/easypopulate.php?langer=install). If you wish to remove and re-install the default
   config settings, type ?langer=remove after /easypopulate.php
   (eg. YOUR_ADMIN/easypopulate.php?langer=remove) and begin this step again.
6) Go to Admin -> Configuration -> Easy Populate, and configure the upload directory if you have
   changed it from default. Also, ensure that the correct date format is set for your upload files.
7) If this mod gives you more time with your family or friends, and/or less customer headaches, please

IMPORTANT!!!
-------------

** your temp folder must have owner permissions to read/write/execute (chmod 700) for EP to work.
   EP now adjusts this for you (unless you have a windows server - ask your host to adjust permissions on this folder for the IIS web server)
** The temp folder has example downloaded files in it. You may wish to delete these before uploading.
** It is recommended that you download a file 1st and use this as a template for your uploads (install should do this for you..)
** If for some reason the config install fails, you can upload the SQL file provided using Admin -> Tools -> Install SQL Patches

That's it!
REMEMBER TO BACK UP EVERYTHING FIRST!
